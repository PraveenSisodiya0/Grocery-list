Grocery List (Python Project)

This is a simple Grocery List program made with Python. You can use it to keep track of things you need to buy.

How It Works
	1.	Run the program.
	2.	You’ll see a menu with 5 options:
	•	1 → Add an item
	•	2 → Remove an item
	•	3 → See your list
	•	4 → Clear the list
	•	5 → Exit
	3.	Enter a number to choose what you want to do.
	4.	Follow the instructions on the screen.
	5.	When you’re done, press 5 to exit.

Example

What You Need
	•	Python 3 installed on your computer.
	•	Just run the script—no extra setup needed!

Why This is Useful

✔️ Super easy to use
✔️ Helps you remember what to buy
✔️ Great for practicing Python

Future Ideas (if you want to improve it)
	•	Save the list so it doesn’t reset when you close the program
	•	Allow updating items instead of just adding/removing
	•	Organize items into categories
